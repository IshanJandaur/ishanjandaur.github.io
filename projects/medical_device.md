**Task/Problem**  
Develop an accurate method to measure the force required to dissect human tissue during a simulated surgical procedure.

**Approach / Actions**  
- Designed and 3D-printed a custom fixture to replicate the surgical procedure.  
- Calibrated off-the-shelf sensors to capture pressure applied by users’ hands.  
- Built and prototyped the system using an Arduino Mega, breadboard, and supporting electrical/wiring components.  
- Iteratively tested and refined the fixture to ensure accurate and repeatable force measurements.

**Results**  
- Created a functional prototype capable of accurately measuring applied forces.  
- Enabled quantitative evaluation of user technique and procedural consistency.  
- Provided a tool for research and training on surgical techniques.

**Skills & Tools Applied**  
- 3D printing
- Arduino
- Sensor/Hardware
- Electronics/Wiring
- Data Acquisition & Analysis 
- Electrical & Wiring: Breadboard prototyping, wiring for sensor integration.
