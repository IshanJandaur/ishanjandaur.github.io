**Task/Problem**  
Validate crimp integrity whenever specifications changed or tooling conversions occurred on the line, and verify supplier-specified CID and vent pressures for safety and compliance.

**Approach / Actions**  
- Designed a hydrostatic burst pressure test using a draw water pump, piping, and pressure gauges to evaluate cylindrical cell samples.  
- Prepared cylindrical cell samples by pipe-cutting crimped ends and fitting them onto swage lock fittings at the test end of the fixture.  
- Implemented a drag pointer pressure gauge to monitor sequential material activations and ensure safety mechanisms triggered at specified pressures.  
- Used the test to check for leaks in crimps and verify proper operation of safety mechanisms, particularly important for Li-Sulfur cells which behave differently than conventional Lithium-Ion cells.  
- Collaborated with vendors to adjust CID and vent pressures based on test results to ensure compliance with UN38.3 and thermal runaway/abuse testing.

**Results**  
- Created a reliable fixture for both in-process quality control (IQC) and development validation.  
- Ensured crimp integrity and confirmed safety mechanisms operated as specified.  
- Provided a critical testing capability for Li-Sulfur cells, improving confidence in safety and performance.  

**Skills & Tools Applied**  
- Test Development
- Assembly and Integration
- DFM of machined parts and DFA of entire assembly 
- UN38.3 testing
