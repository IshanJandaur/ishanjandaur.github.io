**Task/Problem**  
Ensure reliable anode tab welds on a pilot production line by validating process parameters and specifications to achieve proper electrical performance and mechanical integrity.

**Approach / Actions**  
- Controlled and optimized process parameters for the SAT anode tab weld equipment.  
- Validated welds to ensure sufficient current draw and compliance with shock and vibration testing.  
- Conducted extensive DOEs and equipment/material overhauls to optimize the process for the pilot line.  
- Developed QC tests and inspection frequency to monitor production for issues such as sparks, splatter, or insufficient welds.

**Results**  
- Achieved **95% yield at 100 parts per minute** on a pilot line.  
- Ensured weld integrity and compliance with electrical and mechanical requirements.  
- Implemented a robust QC program enabling consistent production without defects.

**Skills & Tools Applied**  
- Process Engineering
- Weld Testing
- Material Development
- Design of Experiments
- Quality Control
