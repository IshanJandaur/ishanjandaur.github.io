My senior design project consisted of developing a robotic bird based on Disneyland’s Barker Bird. I worked with three other engineers to design a 3D-printed skeleton that sang, flapped and extended its wings, and rotated on a base. The project consisted of multiple electromechanical components and customizable code that will be used as a teaching tool for students who want to learn about animatronics.
