## [Crimp/Groove Redesign](/projects/groove_crimp/)

**Task/Problem:**  
Redesigned the can’s neck and groove to ensure compatibility with a new crimping machine and manufacturing process.

**Actions:**  
- Benchmarked existing designs
- Analyzed process capabilities
- Defined tolerances to achieve a precise fit across components and assemblies. 
- Validated performance through burst pressure testing, CT scans, and in-process quality checks.

**Results:** 
Achieving an ~80% yield and a throughput of 100 parts per shift during initial production runs.

## [Injection Molded Parts for Sealing](/projects/injection_mold/)

**Task/Problem:**  
Design a new gasket for the cap that ensures proper fitment with multiple components, including the can and cap pieces.

**Actions:**  
- Collaborated with vendors to select materials 
- Used tolerance stack analysis (RSS) to ensure proper fit
- Leveraged DFM expertise to optimize the injection molded part.

**Results:** 
Successfully implemented the gasket into production to enable +6 Wh/kg gain due to the cap change.

## [Burst Pressure Fixture](/projects/burst_fixture/)

**Task/Problem:**  
Validate crimp integrity and verify supplier-specified CID and vent pressures during specification changes or tooling conversions on the production line.

**Actions:**  
- Designed a hydrostatic burst pressure test using a draw water pump, piping, and pressure gauges 
- Collaborated with vendors to adjust pressures based on 
- Used test results to ensure compliance with UN38.3 and thermal runaway/abuse safety testing.

**Results:** 
Created a reliable tool for both in-process quality checks and development validation

## [Cylindrical Cell Anode Tab Weld Process](/projects/deep_can_weld/)

**Task/Problem:**  
Ensure reliable anode tab welds on the pilot line by validating process parameters and specifications to achieve proper electrical performance and mechanical integrity.

**Actions:**  
- Created and optimized process/machine parameters by conducting extensive DOEs
- Designed and installed equpiment upgrades and material changes
- Developed maintenance schedulee
- Developed QC tests and inspection frequencies

**Results:** 
Achieved ~95% yield at 100 parts per shift on pilot line equipment

## [Barker Bird Animatronic](/projects/barker_bird/)

**Task/Problem:**  
Develop a functional robotic bird inspired by Disneyland’s Barker Bird that can serve as a teaching tool for animatronics.

**Actions:**  
- Collaborated with three engineers to design a 3D-printed skeleton capable of flapping, singing, extending its wings, and rotating on a base. 
- Integrated multiple electromechanical components
- Developed customizable code to control its movements and behaviors.

**Results:** 
Delivered a fully functional robotic bird that demonstrates animatronic principles and serves as an educational tool for students learning electromechanical systems and programming.

## [MEDITEC Medical Device Project](/projects/medical_device)

**Task/Problem:**  
Develop an accurate method to measure the force required to dissect human tissue during a simulated surgical procedure.

**Actions:**  
- Designed and 3D-printed a custom fixture to replicate the surgical procedure. 
- Calibrated off-the-shelf sensors to capture pressure applied by users’ hands. 
- Built and prototyped the system using an Arduino Mega, breadboard, and supporting electrical/wiring components.

**Results:** 
Created a functional prototype capable of accurately measuring applied forces, enabling quantitative evaluation of user technique and procedural consistency.
