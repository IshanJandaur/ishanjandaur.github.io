## Barker Bird Animatronic

My senior design project consisted of developing a robotic bird based on Disneyland’s Barker Bird. I worked with three other engineers to design a 3D-printed skeleton that sang, flapped and extended its wings, and rotated on a base. The project consisted of multiple electromechanical components and customizable code that will be used as a teaching tool for students who want to learn about animatronics.

## Medical Device NDA Project - MEDITEC

We determined an accurate method of monitoring the force required to dissect human tissue. We designed and 3D-printed a fixture to simulate the surgical procedure. Additionally, off-the-shelf sensors were calibrated and used to measure the pressure from the users’ hands. Prototyping was done using an Arduino Mega, a breadboard, and various electrical/wiring components.
